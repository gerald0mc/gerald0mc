### About me:

All I do is code and play games. I have some java knowledge and I have tried to dabble in C#.

### Future Plans?:
At this moment I am a senior in HS graduating in the 2023 class, I will then be taking my Summer break to drive around the states and visit friends. Then I will be entering college for 2 years of Basics and hopefully a school that can start me into what my major what be, just a central idea of Computer Science, but something probably more along the lines of Sys Admin or IT Management. (Also I don't really play Anarchy MC anymore if anyone reading this is from that community.)

### Stuff I Have Worked On/Currently Working On:
* Multiple 1.12.2 clients that nobody cares about
* Gerald(Hack) (1.12.2 Anarchy Client)
* JustAnotherEconomyPlugin (Server plugin)
* Bandito (1.12.2 Anarchy Client)
* GeraldBot (1.12.2 Standalone Chat Bot)
